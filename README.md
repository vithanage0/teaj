tea project
tea is a set of libraries developed for common tasks like executing and manipulating processes, sending emails, file system manipulation, and a great number of utility functions that I caught myself writing over and over again.

Also parts of the tea library can be viewed as a sand-box where I start a module, which eventually, if it grows and become large enough to become a library itself, gets extracted as a separate project.

Modules like dsa (data structures and algorithms), logger, msg, process, shell, utils... will always remain a part of tea.
